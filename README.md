# ZZD: Zig Hexdump Utility

**ZZD** is a [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) re-implementation of the [**XXD**](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd) hexdump utility originally created by **Juergen Weigert**.

The idea for using XXD as a learning exercise was originally from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnnx1bkFXng) by **Low Level Learning**.
